1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

        HTTP1.1:

            * client to server to send 3 TCP connection establish to request send and then server to client there also 3 TCP connection establish
            * it works on the textual format 
            * it uses request resource inlining for use getting multipule pages
            * it compresses data by itself

        HTTP2 :

            * client to server to send 1 TCP connection establish to request send and then server to client there also 1 TCP connection establish
            * it works on the binary protocol
            * it uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages    
            * it uses HPACK for data compression



2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

    * Objects in JavaScript are like magical containers that hold information in key-value pairs,
	  allowing us to organize and access data easily.

	* Internally, objects are represented as collections of properties and methods. 

	* They can contain other objects nested within them, creating a hierarchy of data. 	
    
	* Accessing and modifying object properties is done through dot notation or square brackets.
